# Lumentix – Stellar Event Platform

A decentralized event management platform built on the **Stellar blockchain** that makes event ticketing, payments, and sponsorships as smooth as a Stellar transaction (which is pretty smooth, by the way).

## Architecture

### Frontend (Next.js)

- **Location**: `/frontend/`
- **Tech Stack**: Next.js 14, React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Features**: Event browsing, registration, Stellar payments, real-time status

### Smart Contract (Soroban)

- **Location**: `/contract/`
- **Tech Stack**: Rust, Soroban SDK
- **Features**: Event management, registration tracking, payment verification

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Rust 1.70+
- Soroban CLI

### Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Contract Setup

```bash
cd contract
make setup    # Install dependencies
make build    # Build contract
make test     # Run tests
make deploy   # Deploy to testnet
```

## Smart Contract Development

### Contract Structure

```
contract/
├── src/
│   └── lib.rs              # Main contract implementation
├── scripts/
│   ├── build.sh            # Build script
│   ├── test.sh             # Test script
│   ├── optimize.sh         # Optimization script
│   ├── deploy.sh          # Deployment script
│   └── testnet-setup.sh   # Complete testnet setup
├── Cargo.toml             # Rust dependencies
└── Makefile              # Build automation
```

### Contract Features

- **Event Management**: Create, update, and list events
- **Registration System**: Track attendee registrations
- **Payment Integration**: Verify Stellar payments
- **Access Control**: Admin-only operations
- **Data Storage**: On-chain event and registration data

### Contract Functions

#### Admin Functions

- `initialize(admin)` - Initialize contract with admin
- `create_event(name, description, price, max_attendees)` - Create new event
- `update_event_status(event_id, is_active)` - Update event status

#### Public Functions

- `get_events()` - Get all events
- `get_event(event_id)` - Get specific event
- `register_for_event(event_id, payment_tx_hash)` - Register for event
- `get_event_registrations(event_id)` - Get event registrations
- `get_user_registrations(user)` - Get user's registrations

### Protocol fee query and platform withdrawal (Soroban)

The ticketing contract exposes read-only **protocol (platform) fee** introspection and an admin-only withdrawal of
the **accrued platform fee pool** (separate from per-event escrow paid to organizers after completion).

| Entrypoint | Role | Auth | Primary return | Events |
|------------|------|------|----------------|--------|
| `get_protocol_fee` | Anyone | None | `Ok((fee_bps, fee_recipient))` where `fee_recipient` is the admin; `Err(NotInitialized)` if never initialized | Emits **ProtocolFeeQueried** (`feequery`) on every successful call for analytics |
| `withdraw_platform_fees` | Admin | `admin.require_auth()` | `Ok(amount)` — full prior platform balance, then cleared to zero; `Unauthorized` if not admin; `NoPlatformFees` if balance is zero | Emits **PlatformFeesWithdrawn** (`feewith`) with `(admin, amount)` |

**Panics:** Neither entrypoint uses `panic!` for normal validation. `get_protocol_fee` returns `NotInitialized` before
reading admin. `withdraw_platform_fees` reads the admin from instance storage without an explicit initialized guard; if
the contract were invoked in a corrupted state (initialized flag without admin), underlying storage access could panic.
Use the public `initialize` path only.

**Related:** Organizer “withdrawal” of event proceeds is modeled as **`release_escrow`** after the event reaches a
completed state, not `withdraw_platform_fees`.

## Deployment Guide

### 1. Local Development

```bash
cd contract

# Install dependencies
make setup

# Build contract
make build

# Run tests
make test

# Optimize for deployment
make optimize
```

### 2. Testnet Deployment

```bash
# Quick deployment (auto-generates admin account)
./scripts/deploy.sh

# Or with existing credentials
export ADMIN_SECRET="your_secret_key"
export ADMIN_PUBLIC="your_public_key"
./scripts/deploy.sh
```

### 3. Complete Testnet Setup

```bash
# Sets up fresh contract + test accounts
./scripts/testnet-setup.sh

# Load environment variables
source .testnet.env

# Test the contract
./test-contract.sh
```

### 4. Manual Deployment Steps

```bash
# 1. Build and optimize
make build
make optimize

# 2. Deploy contract
soroban contract deploy \
    --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/lumentix_contract.optimized.wasm \
    --source $ADMIN_SECRET \
    --network testnet

# 3. Initialize contract
soroban contract invoke \
    --id $CONTRACT_ID \
    --source $ADMIN_SECRET \
    --network testnet \
    initialize \
    --admin $ADMIN_PUBLIC
```

## Testing

### Contract Tests

```bash
cd contract

# Run unit tests
make test
# or
cargo test

# Run integration tests
./scripts/testnet-setup.sh
./test-contract.sh
```

### Frontend Tests

```bash
cd frontend
npm test
```

## CI/CD

### GitHub Actions

The project includes automated CI/CD for contract development:

- **Triggers**: Push/PR to main/develop branches with contract changes
- **Jobs**:
  - Run `cargo test`
